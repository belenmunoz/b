<h1>Shakespeare's Sonnets</h1>

<p>Let those who are in favour with their stars,<br />
Of public honour and proud titles boast,<br />
Whilst I whom fortune of such triumph bars<br />
Unlooked for joy in that I honour most;<br />
Great princes' favourites their fair leaves spread,<br />
But as the marigold at the sun's eye,<br />
And in themselves their pride lies buried,<br />
For at a frown they in their glory die.<br />
The painful warrior famoused for fight,<br />
After a thousand victories once foiled,<br />
Is from the book of honour razed quite,<br />
And all the rest forgot for which he toiled:<br />
Then happy I that love and am beloved<br />
Where I may not remove nor be removed.</p>
